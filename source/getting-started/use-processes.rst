Use Processes to create documents from templates
================================================

First of all, `sign in <https://auth.plumsail.com/account/login?returnUrl=https://account.plumsail.com/documents/intro>`_  to Plumsail Account. If you don't have an account yet, then  `sign up <https://auth.plumsail.com/account/Register?ReturnUrl=https://account.plumsail.com/documents/intro/reg>`_.

Processes are an easy way to automate the creation of documents from templates. You can generate and deliver documents in a few simple steps:

.. We DO NOT use here toctree because we don't want to dublicate Processes navigation under Getting started section.

- `Prepare a template for your document <../user-guide/processes/create-template.html>`_
- `Create a new process <../user-guide/processes/create-process.html>`_
- `Test the template with your data <../user-guide/processes/test-template.html>`_
- `Configure how to deliver generated documents (email, OneDrive, etc.) <../user-guide/processes/create-delivery.html>`_
- `Start document generation using Plumsail Forms, Microsoft Flow or REST API <../user-guide/processes/start-process.html>`_

.. note::

  Processes work for most of the scenarios. If you want some advanced operations on documents, take a look at our `Microsoft Flow actions <use-from-flow.html>`_ and `REST API <use-as-rest-api.html>`_.
