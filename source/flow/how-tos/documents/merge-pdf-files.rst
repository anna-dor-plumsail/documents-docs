How to merge PDF files in Microsoft Flow, Azure Logic Apps and PowerApps
==========================================================================

This article demonstrates how to merge PDF files with the help of `Microsoft Flow <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/>`_.

Before starting, ensure that you `added Plumsail Documents connector to Microsoft Flow <https://plumsail.com/docs/actions/v1.x/getting-started/use-from-flow.html>`_.

In this example, we will read three DOCX files from a specific folder, convert these files to PDF, merge them and send the result PDF file by email.

For instance, it may be useful  in a situation when a few employees prepare different sections of a contract at the same time. They load the parts of the contract to a folder, then all files from this folder are merged to form the final document.

So, our source DOCX files have to be stored somewhere. Microsoft Flow has a lot of connectors for different systems. Here are just a few of them:

- SharePoint
- Salesforce
- Box
- OneDrive
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- SFTP
- File System

In this example, we will store our source DOCX files in SharePoint in a library that we named *Source Files Library*, but you can get data from other sources. You may use these links to download 3 sample DOCX files: `1 <../../../_static/files/flow/how-tos/file1.docx>`_, `2 <../../../_static/files/flow/how-tos/file2.docx>`_, `3 <../../../_static/files/flow/how-tos/file3.docx>`_.


Merging PDF files
-------------------

Here, we will guide you step by step through creating the flow. You also will find a screenshot of the complete flow at the end of the article.

Flow trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can actually pick any trigger. For example, you can start Flow on file creation in a SharePoint document library. We use *Manually trigger a flow* trigger here to simplify the Flow.

Get files (properties only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start with getting properties of all our DOCX files stored in a specific folder  - * Source Files Library*. In the next step, we will iterate through the output from this action to get those files contents.

   :alt: Get files (properties only) action

You can use any other connector to get files from your system.

Initialize variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to prepare an array of files, that we will put in *Plumsail Documents  -  Merge PDF action* when composing the final document.

Add a new action and search for *Variables  -  Initialize variable* action. Enter a name for the variable and choose the **Array** type for it.

   :alt: Initialize variable

Get file content using path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, you need to add *Get file content using path* action to get source DOCX files contents.

Click **File Path** field and add there **Folder Path** and **File name with extension** from a menu on the right. This will automatically transform this action into repeating one which will be performed for each file from the source folder.

Convert DOCX to PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an action from `Plumsail Documents connector <https://plumsail.com/docs/actions/v1.x/flow/actions/document-processing.html>`_, which is a part of `Plumsail Actions <https://plumsail.com/actions>`_.

Put here **File content** from the output of the previous action.

You can find more detailed information about *Convert DOCX to PDF* action `here <You can find more detailed information about Convert DOCX to PDF action here.>`_.

Append to array variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, add *Variables  -  Append to array variable* action, enter an element of the array into the **Value field** as shown in the screenshot below. **Result file** here is the output from the previous  operation:

The array of PDF files is ready, now we can move to the  main step  -  merging PDFs into the final document.

Merge PDF
~~~~~~~~~

This is an action from `Plumsail Documents connector <https://plumsail.com/docs/actions/v1.x/flow/actions/document-processing.html>`_, which is a part of `Plumsail Actions <https://plumsail.com/actions>`_.

Click a small array icon on the right to switch to the view where you can input an entire array. Add the **Array of the PDF files** you received in the loop to the **Content of PDF documents** field:

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/merge-PDF.png
   :alt: Merge PDF

Send an Email
~~~~~~~~~

Once the result file is generated, we send an email using *Office 365 Outlook  -  Send email action*. In the **Attachments** section, we add **a name** and **the extension** for the merged PDF file and choose **Result file** output from the previous *Merge PDF* action.

So, here is the complete flow:

Conclusion
-------------------

That is all, the flow is configured. Hope, these steps will help to ease the work with documents.
