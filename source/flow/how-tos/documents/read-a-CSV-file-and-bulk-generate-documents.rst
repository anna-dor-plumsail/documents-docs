How to read a CSV file in Microsoft Flow and bulk generate documents
=============================================================

This article demonstrates how to read CSV files in Microsoft Flow using **Parse CSV** action from Plumsail Documents connector. 
We will use results from thisaction to bulk generate documents.

Let's say a company has a CSV file with customers. They want to bulk generate invitations 
to a conference for all the customers and then print them and send using postal service.

In this example, we will read a CSV file and use the available headers to fill up the invitations.
The invitation will be a result file of **Create DOC document from template** action. 
To fill up the DOCX template we're going to use Parse CSV output items.

Our source CSV file has to be stored somewhere. Microsoft Flow has a lot of connectors for different systems.

Here are just a few of them:

- SharePoint
- Salesforce
- Box
- OneDrive
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- SFTP
- File System

You can store your files anywhere. In this example, we will store our source PDF file in OneDrive folder, but you can get data from any other sources.

- `CSV file <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/_static/files/document-generation/demos/example.csv>`_.
- `DOCX template <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/_static/files/document-generation/demos/invitation-template.docx>`_.



This is how our flow looks:

Below is a step by step description of the flow.

Parsing a CSV file
--------------------

Flow trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can actually pick any trigger. For example, you can start Flow on file creation in a SharePoint document library. We use *Manually trigger a flow* trigger here to simplify the Flow.

Get file content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action gets file content of the specified file from a OneDrive folder. 
Just specify the  **path** to your file. We use this action to read our sample CSV file and the source DOCX template.

You can use any other connector to get files from your system.

Parsing CSV
~~~~~~~~~

This is an action from `Plumsail Documents connector <https://plumsail.com/documents/>`_.

Put CSV file content from the output of the previous action. 
In the **Headers** field, specify the CSV file headers, then you'll be able to select the headers in the dynamic content window.
In our example, we're going to use the customer first name, last name and the company name.

On the next steps we use the action *Create DOCX document from template*.
Template Data is an object, that will be applied to our DOCX template and in our case, we apply just two columns from our CSV to the template, “FirstName” and “LastName”.
You can read more about creating documents from templates `here <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/flow/actions/document-processing.html#create-docx-document-from-template>`_.
After creating a DOCX invitation we convert it to PDF using *company name* item and save it to the OneDrive folder.
