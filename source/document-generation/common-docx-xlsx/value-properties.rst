Value properties in DOCX and XLSX templates
===========================================

You can access different methods and properties on tag values. For example, you can bring a string to the lowercase, get a day, month or year from a date, get a number of items in an array. 

Just use **dot** after tag value as in the example below:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Template
        - Data
        - Result
    *   - .. code-block:: json
    
            {{stringVal.ToLower}}
            {{dateVal.Year}}
            {{arrayVal.Length}}

        - .. code-block:: json

            {                     
                "stringVal": "Jessica Adams",
                "dateVal": "2012-04-21T18:25:43-05:00",
                "arrayVal": [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            }         

        - .. code-block:: json
    
            jessica adams
            2012
            5
