With help of **Create XLSX document from template** action, you can create multiple worksheets in one file.

You can download the source document and the result document for the example described below in `multiple worksheets demo <./demos.html#multiple-worksheets>`_.

Let us take an object containing information about employees working in a company. Each employee has a list of properties. We want to display information about each employee in a separate worksheet. The result document will look like this:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/multiple-worksheets-result.png
    :alt: Multiple worksheets result

Each worksheet has a name and a title with an employee's name.

JSON representation of the object:

.. code:: json

    ]

Now, let us take a look at the source template for this structure:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/multiple-worksheets-template.png
    :alt: Multiple worksheets template

Just type the :code:`{{name}}` tag into the tab name field. The templating engine is smart enough to understand that it needs to render a separate sheet for each employee. The same tag is also used at the top of the sheet. There it just displays regular bold Excel cell with larger font size.

To display employees information we refer objects properties using the dot operator:

- The :code:`{{jobInfo.title}}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the  title property of the *jobInfo* object.
- The :code:`{{jobInfo.dateOfHire}:format(d MMMM yyyy)}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the Date of Hire property and change its format. For more information about value formatting please have a look at the `value formatters  <../common-docx-xlsx/formatters.html>`_ section of the documentation.
- The :code:`{{personalInfo.address}}`, :code:`{{inCaseOfEmergency.name}}` tags let the engine know that we want to render the employee address and the emergency contact name properties of the *personalInfo* and *inCaseOfEmergency* objects.
