With help of **Create DOCX document from template** action, you can create rich tables based on templates with a minimal amount of syntax. In the templates, you can refer properties inside simple objects and collections, as well as properties in nested constructions. Let us check a few examples.

.. _tables:

Regular table
-------------

In this section, we will see how to create a table based on an array of objects.

Let us take an object containing information about a company and a collection of employees working there. Each employee has a list of properties. We want to display the name of the company and its contact email at the top of the page and create a table with information about the employees.

You can download the source document and the result document for this example in `the regular table demo <./demos.html#tables>`_. Description of the example is below.

JSON representation of the object:

.. code:: json

    {
        "company": {
            "name": "Plumsail",
            "email": "contact@plumsail.com"
        },
        "employees": [
            {
                "name": "Derek Clark",
                "jobTitle": "Marketing director",
                "department": "Marketing Department",
                "office": "Room 18",
                "phone": "(206) 854-9798"
            },
            {
                "name": "Xue Li",
                "jobTitle": "Financial director",
                "department": "Financial Department",
                "office": "Room 19",
                "phone": "(206) 598-1259"
            },
            {
                "name": "Jessica Adams",
                "jobTitle": "Marketing manager",
                "department": "Marketing Department",
                "office": "Room 23",
                "phone": "(206) 789-1598"
            },
            {
                "name": "Katsuko Kawakami",
                "jobTitle": "Analyst",
                "department": "Financial Department",
                "office": "Room 26",
                "phone": "(206) 784-1258"
            }
        ]
    }

Now, let us take a look at the source template for this structure:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-template.png
    :alt: Table template

In our template, we can refer properties inside simple objects and collections, as well as properties in nested constructions. To select properties of our objects inside of the array we just use a dot operator:

- The :code:`{{company.name}}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the company name property.
- The :code:`{{company.email}}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the company email property.
- The :code:`{{employees.name}}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the list of employees names.
- The :code:`{{employees.jobTitle}}`, :code:`{{employees.department}}`, :code:`{{employees.office}}`, :code:`{{employees.phone}}` tags let the engine know that we want to render other employees properties.

We designed a table with a header and just one row that contains our tags. The templating engine is smart enough to understand what content needs to be duplicated. It will iterate through all objects in the array to render them and add the rows automatically.

You can choose a design for the table and check the *Banded Rows* check box to make the table rows banded:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/banded-rows.png
    :alt: To make banded rows

You can see the result of rendering below. The templating engine automatically created rows with information about the employees:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-result.png
    :alt: Table template result

.. _dynamic-table:

Dynamic table
-------------

You can create dynamic tables from two-dimensional arrays by just adding a single tag into the template document. The templating engine is smart enough to understand what content needs to be duplicated.

Use a two-dimensional array as a source object. If the engine encounters a two-dimensional array it is able to render the whole table automatically. 

download the source document and the result document for this example in `the dynamic table demo <./demos.html#dynamic-table>`_. Description of the example is below.

Example of the object in JSON format:

.. code:: json

    {
        "myArray": [
            [
                "between",
                "inter-",
                "epi-"
            ],
            [
                "above, excess",
                "super-, ultra-",
                "hyper-"
            ],
            [
                "inside",
                "intra-",
                "endo-"
            ],
            [
                "outside",
                "extra-, extro-",
                "ecto-, exo-"
            ]
        ]
    }

In the template document, create a table and put :code:`{{myArray}}` tag inside of it. The templating engine will understand what content needs to be duplicated. It will automatically create a table.

The template on the top will result in the document at the bottom:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-array.png
    :alt: A table from an array

You may want to turn the first nested array into a table header and to make the rows banded. Just design a table with the corresponding style. The templating engine will automatically render the object according to the chosen design.

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/create-table_table-from-array.png
    :alt: Create a table

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/design-table_table-from-array-small.png
    :alt: Design the table

We have also added an additional nested array for the header to the JSON object:

.. code:: json

    {
        "myArray": [
            [
                "Meaning",
                "Latin prefix",
                "Greek prefix"
            ],
            ...
    }

The template on the top will result in the document at the bottom:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-array-header.png
    :alt: A table from an array with header and banded rows

.. _dynamic-table-columns:

Dynamic table columns
---------------------

You can create table columns dynamically from arrays by just adding a single tag into the template document. The templating engine is smart enough to understand what content needs to be duplicated.

download the source document and the result document for this example in `the dynamic table columns demo <./demos.html#dynamic-table-columns>`_. Description of the example is below.

Let us take an object containing information about a company and a list of employees working there. Each employee object contains a name and an array of detailed information about the employee.

We want to display the name of the company and contacts at the top of the page and create a table with information about the employees.

JSON representation of the object:

.. code:: json

    {
        "company": "Plumsail",
        "contacts": {
            "website": "http://plumsail.com",
            "support": "contacts@plumsail.com",
            "sales": "sales@plumsail.com"
        },
        "employees": [
            {
                "name": "Derek Clark",
                "metadata": [
                    [
                        "Marketing director",
                        "Room 18",
                        "(206) 854-9798"
                    ]
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Xue Li",
                "metadata": [
                    [
                        "Financial director",
                        "Room 19",
                        "(206) 598-1259"
                    ]
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Jessica Adams",
                "metadata": [
                    [
                        "Marketing manager",
                        "Room 23",
                        "(206) 789-1598"
                    ]
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Katsuko Kawakami",
                "metadata": [
                    [
                        "Analyst",
                        "Room 26",
                        "(206) 784-1258"
                    ]
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

As you can see, the :code:`metadata` property is a two-dimensional array. It is important because the array is required to create table columns dynamically. A new column will be created for each item of the array.

Now, let us take a look at the source template for this structure:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-columns-from-array-template.png
    :alt: Table columns from array template

To refer properties inside objects or collections we just use a dot operator:

- The :code:`{{contacts.website}}`, :code:`{{employees.support}}`, :code:`{{employees.sales}}` tags let the engine know that we want to render properties of the contacts object.
- The :code:`{{employees.name}}` tag lets the engine know that we want to render the list of employees names.
- The :code:`{{employees.metadata}}` tag inside a table cell lets the engine know that we want to render the employees metadata by adding dynamic columns.

To render the array of employees we designed a very simple two cells table. The templating engine will see that there is the array in the table cell and add table columns automatically for each element of the :code:`metadata` array.

You can see the result of rendering below. The templating engine automatically created columns with information about the employees:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/table-columns-from-array-result.png
    :alt: Table columns from array template result

.. _repeat-multiple-table-rows:

Repeat multiple table rows
--------------------------

You already learned how to create different kinds of tables. In the examples above we always repeated a single table row for a single object from a source object. But you can actually occupy multiple table rows by a single object and repeat those rows for each object of your source array.

download the source document and the result document for this example in `the repeat multiple table rows demo <./demos.html#repeat-multiple-table-rows>`_. Description of the example is below.

Let us assume we have a list of employees:

.. code:: json

    [
        {
            "name": "David Navarro",
            "title": "Head of Marketing",
            "aboutMe": "I like programming \nand good coffee."    
        },
        {
            "name": "Jessica Adams",
            "title": "HR",
            "aboutMe": "I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience."    
        },
        {
            "name": "Anil Mittal",
            "title": "Sales manager",
            "aboutMe": "I am a dedicated person with a family of four."    
        } 
    ]

We want to put name and job title in the first table row and the "about me" information in the second row. Then we want to repeat both lines for each employee.

This is how our source template will look in this case:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/repeat-multiple-table-rows-template.png
                :alt: Repeat multiple table rows template

And this is the result document:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/document-generation/repeat-multiple-table-rows-result.png
                :alt: Repeat multiple table rows result

The templating engine understands that we used tags for properties of the same object in both table rows. Thus, it knows that it needs to repeat both rows.
